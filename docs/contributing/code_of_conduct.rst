Code of Conduct
===============

1. Purpose
----------

A primary goal of Kolibri and KA Lite is to be inclusive to the largest
number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds
possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and
welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack
thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who
participate in our community, as well as the consequences for
unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Kolibri or KA Lite to help us
create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

2. Open Source Citizenship
--------------------------

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source
citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the
relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action
is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of
power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community
is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to
the fullest extent, we also want to know!

3. Expected Behavior
--------------------

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community
members:

-  Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you
   contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
-  Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
-  Attempt collaboration before conflict.
-  Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and
   speech.
-  Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
   Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone
   in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem
   inconsequential.
-  Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of
   the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

4. Unacceptable Behavior
------------------------

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable
within our community:

-  Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against
   another person.
-  Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise
   discriminatory jokes and language.
-  Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
-  Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying
   information ("doxing").
-  Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual
   orientation, race, religion, or disability.
-  Inappropriate photography or recording.
-  Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent
   before touching them.
-  Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or
   jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual
   advances.
-  Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
-  Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
-  Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and
   presentations.

5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
----------------------------------------

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and
those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and
including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community
without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

6. Reporting Guidelines
-----------------------

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any
other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.
codeofconduct@learningequality.org.

The Reporting Guidelines can be viewed further down in this document.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community
members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those
experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of
in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the
person experiencing distress.

7. Addressing Grievances
------------------------

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this
Code of Conduct, you should notify Learning Equality with a concise
description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in
accordance with our existing governing policies.

The Enforcement Manual can be viewed by scrolling further down this
document.

8. Scope
--------

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise;
sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all
community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one
communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to
unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community
activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the
safety and well-being of community members.

Reporting Guidelines
--------------------

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you
report it to the Learning Equality by emailing
codeofconduct@learningequality.org. All reports will be kept confidential. In
some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be
made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters
will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate
law enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is
appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to
notify them.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the
space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage
you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports
where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an
actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the
incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not
violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve
the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

In your report please include:

#. Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to
   follow up)
#. Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.
   If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as
   well.
#. When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
#. Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available
   record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public Slack logger) please
   include a link.
#. Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
#. If you believe this incident is ongoing.
#. Any other information you believe we should have.

What happens after you file a report?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will receive an email from the Code of Conduct committee
acknowledging receipt within 48 hours (we aim to be quicker than that).

The committee will immediately meet to review the incident and
determine:

#. What happened.
#. Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
#. Who the bad actor was.
#. Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to
   anyone's physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical
safety, the committee's immediate priority will be to protect
everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until
we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically
safe.

Once the committee has a complete account of the events they will
make a decision as to how to response. Responses may include:

* Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
* A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s)
  involved.
* A public reprimand.
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a
  mailing list or Slack).
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all communication spaces (mailing
  lists, Slack, etc.)
* A request for a public or private apology.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with
either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet
resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original
reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll
take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of
our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.


Enforcement Manual
------------------

This is the enforcement manual followed by Learning Equality's Code of Conduct
Committee. It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're
consistent and fair. It should be considered an internal document, but
we're publishing it publicly in the interests of transparency.

The Code of Conduct Committee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by a Code
of Conduct Committee ("the committee").

Learning Equality's (LE's) core team ("the core") will
establish this committee, comprised of at least three members.


How the committee will respond to reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a report is sent to the committee, a member will reply with a receipt
to confirm that a process of reading your report has started.

See the Reporting Guidelines for details of what reports should contain.
If a report doesn't contain enough information, the committee will
obtain all relevant data before acting. The committee is empowered to
act on the LE's behalf in contacting any individuals involved to get a
more complete account of events.

The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best
of their ability:

* what happened
* whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation
* who, if anyone, was the bad actor
* whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to
  anyone's physical safety

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
committee's deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. Slack
transcripts, email discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc).

The committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one
week. In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time,
the committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected
timeline for resolution.


Acting Unilaterally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the act is ongoing or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of
violence), any committee member may act immediately (before reaching
consensus) to end the situation. In ongoing situations, any member may
at their discretion employ any of the tools available to the committee,
including bans and blocks.

If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the committee may
-- and should -- act unilaterally to protect safety. This can
include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and
speaking on behalf of Learning Equality.

In situations where an individual committee member acts unilaterally, they
must report their actions to the committee for review within 24 hours.


Resolutions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the committee
cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the committee will
turn the matter over to the board for resolution.

Possible responses may include:

* Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).
* A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s)
  involved. In this case, the committee will deliver that reprimand to
  the individual(s) over email, cc'ing the committee.
* A public reprimand. In this case, the committee will deliver that
  reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. in Slack for
  an Slack violation; email for an email violation, etc.). The committee may
  choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a
  mailing list or Slack). The committee will communicate this "vacation"
  to the individual(s). They'll be asked to take this vacation
  voluntarily, but if they don't agree then a temporary ban may be imposed
  to enforce this vacation.
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Learning Equality spaces (mailing
  lists, Slack, etc.). The committee will maintain records of all such bans so
  that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new Learning Equality
  fora, or otherwise maintained.
* A request for a public or private apology. The committee may, if it chooses,
  attach "strings" to this
  request: for example, the committee may ask a violator to apologize in order
  to retain his or her membership on a mailing list.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the
committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties
and explain the proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this
resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record.
However, the committee is not required to act on this feedback.

Finally, the committee will make a report for the core team.

The committee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public
statements will be made by the core team.

Conflicts of Interest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the event of any conflict of interest a committee member must
immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.

Changes made to the original doc: Instead of involving a board as DSF has,
the core team at Learning Equality is considered. Instead of IRC, we refer to
Slack. The Code of Conduct Committee does not have a single chair but acts as
a group to make conflicts of interest easier, and to avoid problems in case of
absence of the chair person. Instead of interchanging "working group" and
"committee" notation, we replaced all occurrences of "working group" and "group"
with "committee".
